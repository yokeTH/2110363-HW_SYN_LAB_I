## Usage

Follow the instructions in each lab's README file to complete the assignments. Each lab will have a `README.md` that details the file hierarchy, including source files and constraints needed to run the assignments.

### Example

To run the synthesis for `Lab6`:

1. Open Vivado Design Suite.
2. Navigate to the `Lab6` directory.
3. Open the project file or create a new project and add the `System.v` file.
4. Add any necessary constraint files as specified in the `README.md` of Lab6.
5. Run the synthesis and implementation processes.
6. Generate the bitstream and program the FPGA.

Repeat similar steps for other labs, referring to their respective `README.md` files for specific instructions.
